# Markdown + Additional Rules     
 <bhr>Big title</bhr>            
 # Header on left                
 - List 1 <u>underline< /u>       
 - - -                            
 # Header on right                
 - List 2                         
= = =                           
 <bhr>Big title on next page</bhr>
---
## Parser
1. Split the markdown file into **Slides**.                         
2. Split the slides into **SlideBlocks** (columns).                 
3. Identify each line is Header, List, Qote, Image, or Plain Text.
4. Parse each line to identify the styles (bold, italics, etc.)

### Interface
[                                            
 [                                          
    [BigHeader "Big title"],                     
    [Header 1 [Plain "Header on left"],          
     ListBullet 1 [Plain "plain", Bold "bold"]]  
    [Header 2 [Plain "Header on right"]         
 ],                                            
 [                                          
  [BigHeader "Big title on next page"]      
 ]                                          
]

# Brick Interface
`data AppState {`
`    slides,    `
`    curIndex,  `
`    images     `
`}              `
 
- `appDraw` - draw elements top to down
- `handleEvent` - switch ppt page     
---
## Visualizing One Slide
- `visualizeBlock` - care for block layout   
- `visualizeMD` - care for markdown type     
- `visualizeText` - care for specific elements

<bhr>Unit  Test  +  Development</bhr>
---
### Unit Test
- `Test.tasty` framework for testing 
- Multiple unittest added during dev
- Push hook before pushing to remote
---
#### Development
- Fixed interface at the first meeting
- Independent development            
    - parser                         
    - visualizer

### <u>Nested</u> structures
- Design to parse the nested structures
- "Underline" inside a Header needs to be aware of the outer style.
- Generalize to multi-level of lists.

#### Manipulation on Brick `widgets`
- Alignment                          
    - Left align vs. center align        
- Layout                             
    - Element as minimal visualized unit  
    - Element encapsulated by content block
        - Differentiate for each Markdown type
        - Differentiate according to context 
### Styling is very interesting!
Colors and emojis are fun.

### How to read image
- JuicyPixel package `readImage`       
- Read image in `initialState`         
    - IO cannot be done in non-IO func
    - Reading images is slow         
## How to set AttrMap
- AttrMap is static but color space is 256 x 256 x 256
- Discretize color to 8 x 8 x 8
