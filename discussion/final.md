#### Manipulation on Brick `widgets`
- Alignment                           
   - Left align vs. center align         
- Layout                              
   - Element as minimal visualized unit   
   - Element encapsulated by content block
       - Differentiate for each Markdown type
       - Differentiate according to context  
 
### Styling is very interesting!
 
Colors and emojis are fun.

### How to read image
- JuicyPixel package `readImage`        
- Read image in `initialState`          
    - IO cannot be done in non-IO func
    - Reading images is slow          
## How to set AttrMap
- AttrMap is static but color space is 256 x 256 x 256
- Discretize color to 8 x 8 x 8
